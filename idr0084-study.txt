Study Title	Activation of alpha-globin transcription in primary mouse erythroid progenitors
Study Type	in-situ hybridization assay
Study Type Term Source REF	EFO
Study Type Term Accession	OBI_0001686
Study Description	Mammalian gene expression patterns are controlled by regulatory elements, which interact within Topologically Associating Domains (TADs). The relationship between activation of regulatory elements, formation of structural chromatin interactions and gene expression during development is unclear. Here, we present Tiled-C, a low-input Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technique. We use this approach to study chromatin architecture at high spatial and temporal resolution through in vivo mouse erythroid differentiation. In this dataset, we measure nascent transcription of the mouse alpha-globin genes by FISH using oligonucleotide probes that are specific for the alpha-globin introns. We measure the initial stages of alpha-globin upregulation in three subsets of early erythroid progenitors (S0-low, S0-medium and S1) and compare these to the levels observed in a positive control (mature, Ter119+ mouse erythroblasts) and in two negative controls (mouse primary brain, which does not express alpha-globin, and a no primary antibody control).

Protocol Description	Primary erythroid progenitor cells were isolated from fetal livers, which were freshly isolated at e12.5-e13.5 from C57BL/6 mouse embryos. 5-15 livers were pooled together for each experimental replicate, mechanically dissociated in staining buffer (PBS, 0.2% BSA, 5mM Glucose) and strained through a 30-μm strainer. Cells were immunostained at 4 °C in the presence of rabbit IgG (200 μg/ml, Jackson Laboratories 015-000-003) to block Fc receptors. To enrich for early erythroid progenitors, cells were first stained with 5 μg/ml biotin-conjugated anti-Ter119 (BD 553672) for 30 minutes, before magnetic depletion using streptavidin nanobeads (BioLegend Mojosort 480016) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then incubated with 0.5 μg/ml APC-conjugated streptavidin (BD 553672), 0.33 μg/ml PE-Cy7-conjugated anti-CD71 (BioLegend 113811) and a panel of 5 FITC-conjugated lineage antibodies (anti-CD41, anti-CD45R, anti-CD3e, anti-CD11b and anti-Ly-6G/6C, all at 1 μg/ml; BD 553848, 553087, 553061, 557396 and 553126, respectively) for 45 minutes. Cells were then resuspended in FACS running buffer (staining buffer plus 2 mM EDTA). 0.66 μg/ml Hoechst was added immediately prior to sorting in order to distinguish live cells. Cells were sorted into Eppendorf tubes containing 500 μl RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS using a BD FACSAria™ Fusion machine with a 100 μM nozzle size.	Sorted cells from mouse fetal liver were placed back into culture for 6 hours to allow nascent transcription to be re-established. Samples were hybridized with digoxygenin-labelled oligonucleotide probes directed to alpha-globin introns (30 ng per slide; pool of four oligonucleotides with sequences AGCTGCCCACTGAGCGAGTGCCAGGTCCAT, GAGAAGTTGAGGTCACAGAAAAGCATAGTT, CTTCCTAGGGGTCCCAGATGCCGCCTGCCA, CCACTATGTTCCCTGCCTTGGGCACGAGGA) and visualized using FITC-conjugated antibodies (primary: sheep anti-DIG FITC [Roche 11207741910] 1:50, secondary: rabbit anti-sheep FITC [Vector FI-6000] 1:100). Two negative controls were also included: brain tissue from a male, adult CD1 mouse and Ter119+ (i.e. mature) fetal liver erythroid cells that were probed with secondary antibody but no primary antibody. Magnetically purified but not FACS-purified Ter119+ fetal liver erythroid cells were used as a positive control.	Widefield fluorescence imaging was performed at 20 °C on a DeltaVision Elite system (Applied Precision) equipped with a 100 ×/1.40 NA UPLSAPO oil immersion objective (Olympus), a CoolSnap HQ2 CCD camera (Photometrics), DAPI (excitation 390/18; emission 435/40) and FITC (excitation 475/28; emission 525/45) filters. 12-bit image stacks were acquired with a z-step of 150 nm giving a voxel size of 64.5 nm x 64.5 nm x 150 nm.	Image analysis was blinded by renaming image files from all experiments with random character strings and processing them together. Images were manually examined, and each cell was scored for the presence of active nascent-transcription foci. Analysis scripts are available at https://github.com/rbeagrie/alpha-tiledc
